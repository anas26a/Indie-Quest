Programming and production Our program is divided into 5 sections, intended to be covered in 1 year of full-time study.</h1>
<table class="curriculumtable">
  <tr>
    <th>
1. Preparation
The Indie Quest requires no previous experience in programming.
 Through carefully designed missions, you will conquer the basics of programming by coding individual aspects of games.
You will learn how computers work and touch on other aspects of computer science,
 such as computational thinking and algorithm design,
  so that you will have the foundation to tackle any programming problems thrown your way.
</th>
<th>
  2. Text adventure
Its time to design your first game. You will choose your own theme and write a text adventure with various locations, characters, and objects to manipulate. It's up to you what the goal of the game is. The project will be bigger than previous missions and require a more organized approach.
Skills covered:
Game design documentation
Code organization
Functional programming basics
Project management
</th>
<th>
  3. Arcade game
Your next project is a simple, top-down, one-screen arcade game, such as a space shooter. You will take your coding knowledge and use it to learn game programming with the Unity game engine.

</th>
<th>3.5 Game Jam
  Before we move on to more learning, you will participate in a 72-hours game jam that will bring everyone at Spellkolektivet together to create games based around a shared theme. You could work alone or take the opportunity to team up, either with other students or join the rest of the developers from the house.
  </th>
  <th>
    4. Platformer
With basic game architecture knowledge under your belt, it's time to create a complex game that will use all the most common components you'll need in any game project. This will be the last guided project before starting your final game.

  </th>
  <th>
    5. Final project
The game you will graduate the program with will be completely up to you. It's time to put all you've learned into a polished product, optionally learning some advanced topics along the way. You can go at it alone, or join forces with another classmate or two.
